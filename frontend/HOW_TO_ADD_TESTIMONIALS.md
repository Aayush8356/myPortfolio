# How to Add Real Testimonials

The testimonials section is currently showing "Coming Soon" because no real testimonials are added yet.

## Quick Steps to Add Real Testimonials:

### 1. Open the Testimonials Component
File: `src/components/Testimonials.tsx`

### 2. Find the Real Testimonials Array
Look for this section around line 93:
```typescript
// REAL testimonials - Add actual testimonials here when you receive them
const realTestimonials: Testimonial[] = [
  // Add real testimonials here
];
```

### 3. Add Real Testimonials
Replace the empty array with actual testimonials:

```typescript
const realTestimonials: Testimonial[] = [
  {
    id: 'real-1',
    name: 'John Smith',
    role: 'Senior Developer',
    company: 'ABC Company',
    content: 'Aayush is an excellent developer who delivered high-quality work on our React project. His attention to detail and problem-solving skills impressed our entire team.',
    rating: 5,
    relationship: 'Colleague',
    projectContext: 'E-commerce Website Development',
    linkedinUrl: 'https://linkedin.com/in/john-smith' // Optional
  },
  // Add more testimonials...
];
```

## To Temporarily Show Placeholder Testimonials:

If you want to show the placeholder testimonials for demonstration:

1. Change line 29 from:
```typescript
const showPlaceholderTestimonials = false;
```

2. To:
```typescript
const showPlaceholderTestimonials = true;
```

## Current Status:
- ✅ Component ready for real testimonials
- ✅ Proper fallback message when no testimonials
- ✅ Professional "Coming Soon" display
- ⏳ Waiting for real testimonials to be added

## Getting Testimonials:
1. **Ask previous classmates** about group projects
2. **Request from faculty** who supervised your projects  
3. **Contact anyone** you've helped with coding/projects
4. **Ask current connections** on LinkedIn
5. **Client testimonials** from any freelance work

Keep testimonials honest and factual. Even a simple 2-3 sentence testimonial is valuable!
